# Cryptocurrencies
We were tasked to perform unsupervised machine learning on a dataframe of cryptocurrencies. We used unsupervised learning because we didn't already have an outcome we were looking for. We had to transform the data and make sure it was ready to be used by our machine learning model. One area where I deviated from the challenge instructions was that I cleaned up the algorithm and the ProofType columns. Both columns had 4 or 5 significant values with many insignificant values so I ran a lambda function to remove all but the main entries and called them other. Then I used the label encoder to give them numeric values instead of string values. The result was a more usable 3D cluster in my opinion.
